                We will ask you to link your Discord with Hack@UCF.
                This allows us to help expedite the sign-up process and, in the future, let you manage your membership
                from within Discord.

                    Onboard is a custom Python3 application that handles membership for Hack@UCF. It was written by
                    <a href="https://divi.sh" target="_blank">Jeffrey</a> and is currently maintained by <a href="jontyms.com">Jonathan.</a>
                    It was designed make it easier to get started with joining the club, since historically we had ~5 different steps that
                    had to be filled out.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Onboard is powered by SQLite, Stripe, and the Discord API. When you link your Discord
                    with Onboard, we collect some account metadata, such as your user ID, profile image, email, 2FA status, and
                    username.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Every person who links their Discord, regardless if they pay dues, will be given a Hack@UCF ID. This is a
                    unique identifier that we can use in place of University identifiers (such as your UCF ID) to verify membership.
                    You can access your Hack@UCF ID via the "My Membership" page.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We also will, at the end of sign-up, ask for payment. We have a third-party vendor,
                    <a href="https://stripe.com/" target="_blank">Stripe</a>,
                    handle payments securely. We do not ever get your card information.
